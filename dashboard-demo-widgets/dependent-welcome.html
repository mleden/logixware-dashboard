			<h3>Welcome to Logixware Dashboard!</h3>
			<p>
				Logixware Dashboard is a jQuery plugin that allows for easy creation and management of dashboard interfaces.
				It is built on top of jQuery and uses Bootstrap 3 for responsive, mobile-ready styling.
				Each "dashboard" is made up of "widgets" arranged in one of 5 "layouts".  
				The plugin provides	the end-user of your dashboard with the ability to:
				<ul>
				<li>
					Add or remove widgets
				</li>
				<li>
					Move widgets via a drag-and-drop interface
				</li>
				<li>
					Maximize or minimize widgets
				</li>
				<li>
					View meta data about widgets
				</li>
				<li>
					Change the layout
				</li>
				</ul>
				The plugin uses "templates" to minimize the amount of HTML required to build dashboards and widgets.
